Hashing and Encoding GUI

A hashing and encoding GUI built on top of the [FileChooser2 demo for Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/examples/components/index.html#FileChooserDemo2), part of the [Java Swing tutorial on file choosers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/filechooser.html).
Originally built in 2018 and modernized in 2025 for modern Java. Credits for all libraries used are within the GUI itself in the credits window.
Variants with and without encoding are included in this repository.
